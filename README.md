I made a Contact List app with another team member for an Android mobile using SQLite as the database for storage. The following features were implemented:

View a list of contacts.
Add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, email, and photo.
Edit existing contacts.
Delete contacts.
Capture contact photos using the device's camera.
Import contact information (name, email, phone) from the default app to your contact app.
